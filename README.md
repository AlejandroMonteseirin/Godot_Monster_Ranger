# Godot_Monster_Ranger

Prototype inspired by the classic **PokÃ©mon Ranger** series.  
Players use their mouse to draw circles around wild monsters to capture them, combining precision, timing, and strategy. The game features **5 exciting levels**, each with increasing difficulty and new monster behaviors to challenge your skills.

> This project was developed as a hobby prototype and is open-source for anyone interested in continuing or expanding it.  
> The current version focuses on **PC gameplay**, although an early mobile version was explored during development.
